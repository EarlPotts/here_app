# here_app

## Inspiration
As a student org member/officer I've seen how much work it is to create individual forms for every org event and sharing it with the guests. And as a guest it gets annoying having to fill out our same personal info for every event with every org. Thus I aimed to fix it.
## What it does
"Here" allows event hosts to quickly and easily create events and have guest lists generated automatically. It also allows guests to store their personal info in our database (securely of course) and quickly sign into events with a flash.
## How we built it
I used Flutter which is a cross platform app kit. With Flutter, we are able to build apps for iOS, Android, and the Web with the same code base. So right away "Here" works on all 3 platforms
## Challenges we ran into
There was recently a huge flutter update that left a lot of my tools outdated, which caused a bunch of weird issues.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to get a full mobile app with a functioning front-end and backend that serves our purpose.
## What we learned
Definitely learned how to work with cameras and other mobile app techniques I'd never used before.
## What's next for Here Mobile/Web App
I plan to update the UI/UX to be more eye-catching and accessible. I also plan to add the following features: csv exports for hosts' guest lists, custom fields to add to specific forms, and a screen for guests to keep track of the events they've attended.
